# Albums and songs API

An API was built in Django that allows users to sign up, log in, and register albums and songs. In its first version, it used APIView, Serializer, and SQLite3.

For its second version, I've refactored it, transitioning to Generic Views, ModelSerializer, and Postgres for its database, all while preserving the original concept and behavior.

Technologies used in this project: Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Simple JWT
